# Examples

Some examples of Slisp in action including:
- peuler.slisp project euler problems
- kadane.isp solution to kadanes problem
- aoc*.isp advent of code solutions

The aim of these examples is to get a tests suite of problems
to verify the interpreter they are not intended to be the "best" solutions 
merely ones that either use weird functionality or are the expected average code.

## Running Examples

```
    python main.py
    (import "tests/all.slisp")
```
